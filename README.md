# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

As part of the Computer Science curriculum at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, I completed the **Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming** course. This course covered foundational and advanced concepts of OOP, including:

- **OOP Principles**: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
- **Design Patterns**
- **Generic Programming**

The primary language used was **Java**, and the course lasted **10 weeks**. Throughout the course, we worked on **5 exercises** (numbered 0 - 4) in various fields, each helping us understand how to design software systems with OOP.
