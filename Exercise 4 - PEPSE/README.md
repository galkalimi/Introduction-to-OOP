# Exercise 4 - Fun and Simple 2D game

### Introduction

*PEPSE* is a project from HUJI's "Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming" course. This game features a jumping man navigating a Minecraft-like environment. It is a procedural simulation developed without a win/lose condition at this stage. The simulation replicates elements of reality, featuring a dynamic environment and character interactions.

Players can manage an energy bar displayed at the top of the screen, which regenerates while standing still and when collecting fruits from trees.

While the core gameplay is relatively straightforward, the implementation provided valuable challenges, including the opportunity to learn a new package. The project also incorporated concepts of functional programming, such as method references and callbacks, alongside a basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) pattern known as the observer pattern.
