# Exercise 2 - Arkanoid

### Introduction

*Arkanoid* is an exercise from HUJI's "Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming" course. 

This project involves creating an Arkanoid game with exciting enhancements and features that elevate the standard version, making it more interactive and engaging.

Each brick might contain a suprising new element that would be added to the game, give it a try!

Working on this project deepened my understanding of OOP principles, especially in how to approach problem-solving through better design strategies.
